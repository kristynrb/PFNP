# HTML
Structure of a web page

# CSS
Cascading Style Sheet
- Appearance of a web page - aesthetics, like text size/background color, and layout - margins, padding, border, etc.

- Box model - quickly draw out how elements are laid out on the page, note that giving your elements padding makes them easier to use

    - How languages evolve - HTML/CSS have had many different versions, each new one adds more features. HTML5 in particular adds many new tags that make it easier for folks who are vision impaired to use your site (screen readers). It also makes it easier for developers to read code (if you see a tag that says <video> you're going to understand what is inside these tags than if it's given the general tag of <div>; CSS3 adds more transitions & options, but we will talk about specifics later.
    
# JavaScript
A programming language - this is different from a markup language like HTML/CSS. It performs logic, executes commands; creates the interactivity of the page by reacting to user input (think clicking buttons, scrolling, etc.).
