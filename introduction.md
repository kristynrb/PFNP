#The internet and World Wide Web
Key Terms and Ideas

The Internet is an **inter**connected **net**work of computers that can send messages back and forth from one computer to the other.

The World-Wide Web is a service which is run over the internet backbone, much like how Netflix's DVD business is a service that's built on top of the US postal service. A service is an interaction between two parties: a client, which makes requests, and a server, which delivers on those requests.

In the case of the web, the client (usually a program called a web browser) requests documents called web pages, and then tries to display (or render) those pages for the user to see.

These web pages are served up by a web application, a program that runs indefinitely and listens for requests coming in over the web. In order to create these pages, the application uses a tool for storing large amounts of data, called a database, to read and write data related to the application's job.

In general, the part of interacting with a web application that happens in the browser is referred to as the front-end, while the rest of the app is commonly referred to as the back-end.

## Command Line

When we are developing applications, developers use their terminal to navigate through their folders and files. It is an interface in which you can type and execute text based commands.

To access your terminal, do the following:

**For Macs:**

`command` + `space`
type `Terminal`

**For PCs:**

`ctrl` + `alt` + `t`

When using the terminal, here are shortcuts to help us navigate, create, delete, etc.

| Command | Meaning |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| `pwd` | Print working directory. This tells you what folder you're currently located in. |
| `cd PATH/TO/FOLDER` | Change directory. This allows you to change the directory you're currently working in. |
| `cd ..` | Move up and out of the folder you're in one level. |
| `ls` | List. Lists all files & folders in your current working directory. |
| `mkdir FOLDERNAME` | Make directory. Creates a new folder with whatever name you choose. |
| `touch FILENAME` | Creates a new file with whatever name you choose. |
| `rm FILENAME` | Remove. Permanently deletes a file. |
| `rm -rf FOLDER` | Permanently deletes a folder and everything inside of it. **Use with caution.** |
| `open FILENAME` | Open a file with the default program. |
| `open .` | Opens the current directory in Finder. |

Alternative names for the terminal:

- Console
- Shell
- Command Line
- Command Prompt
