## Command Line

When we are developing applications, developers use their terminal to navigate through their folders and files. It is an interface in which you can type and execute text based commands.

To access your terminal, do the following:

**For Macs:**

`command` + `space`
type `Terminal`

**For PCs:**

`ctrl` + `alt` + `t`

When using the terminal, here are shortcuts to help us navigate, create, delete, etc.

| Command | Meaning |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| `pwd` | Print working directory. This tells you what folder you're currently located in. |
| `cd PATH/TO/FOLDER` | Change directory. This allows you to change the directory you're currently working in. |
| `cd ..` | Move up and out of the folder you're in one level. |
| `ls` | List. Lists all files & folders in your current working directory. |
| `mkdir FOLDERNAME` | Make directory. Creates a new folder with whatever name you choose. |
