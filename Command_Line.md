# Command Line

When we are developing applications, developers use their terminal to navigate through their folders and files. It is an interface in which you can type and execute text based commands.

To access your terminal, do the following:

For Macs:
`command` + `space`
type `Terminal`

For PCs:
`ctrl` + `alt` + `t`

When using the terminal, here are shortcuts to help us navigate, create, delete, etc.

| `cd PATH/TO/FOLDER` | Change directory. This allows you to change the directory you're currently working in. |
