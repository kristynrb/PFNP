### Subject: Welcome to PFNP! [General Assembly]

Hi everyone,

My name is [YOUR NAME] and I will be leading your Programming for Non-Programmers course [DATES]. It looks like we have a small class which means we'll have lots of flexibility and opportunity to cover topics that interest you.

Before tomorrow, please do the following:

1) Sign up for a Zoom account at https://zoom.us. This is the video conferencing application we'll be using to conduct the class. 

2 ) Test out your Zoom account by follow this link: [ADD YOUR ZOOM LINK] to access our classroom.You should get a message like, "Waiting for the host to start this meeting...". Once you've gotten that message, you'll know that your account is working.

3) Sign up for a Github account at https://github.com. 
Github is "the social network of code", and most web developers (and many non-web developers) use it extensively.

4) Download Atom: https://atom.io/. 
This is the text editor that we will be using to write our code.

5) Make sure that you have Chrome (the web browser) on your computer. If you do not, please download it here: https://www.google.com/chrome/

6) Create an account on Cloud9: https://c9.io/
We may not get to use this, but have an account ready in case we have time. You may need a credit card to verify your identity, but you will not be charged.

7) If you plan on using a computer that is something other than a Mac for our class, please reply to this email and let me know.

Set yourself up for success: make sure that you have a quiet place to participate in class this week. In addition to this, it can be helpful to use a pair of headphones with a built-in microphone during class. You will be on camera and we will be recording the lesson. These are full-day classes, but I have built in breaks to stretch, walk around, get drinks, etc. You also have a time built in for lunch. Come ready to learn and ask questions!

You can join our virtual classroom by going to this link: [ADD YOUR ZOOM LINK]

We'll be starting promptly at 10:00am EST, so I recommend joining the room a few minutes early. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

I look forward to meeting you all,
