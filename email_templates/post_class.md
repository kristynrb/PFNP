- To search for any application on your computer, press command + space bar (for Macs) to open up your Spotlight. For Windows users, press your Windows button and type in the search field.
- To comment out pieces of code in your application, highlight the code and then press command + / (for Macs) andctrl + / (for PC)
- Keep your code easy to read for yourself, and other developers who may look at it, by properly indenting pieces of code. Here's a link with some more details about it: https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html/
